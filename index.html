        <p>Hi friends 👋,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Happy Tuesday! Yesterday was a holiday in the US – Martin Luther King,
          Jr. Day — so we’re coming to you on a rare Tuesday. We’ll be back to
          normal next week.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve been trying to take holidays off, I really have, but I just
          couldn’t
          <em>not</em> write this one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hopefully, this is the last time we have such a general, non-useful
          debate around web3. I appreciate the Prof for laying out all of the
          Oppositions’ points so we can knock them down and move on.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Let’s get to it.</p>

          On Friday, everybody’s favorite Professor sent out a piece titled,
          simply,
          <em><a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/web3/" rel="">Web3</a>.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn’t receive it. I don’t subscribe. But my dad forwarded it to me,
          with an “uh oh…”&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Uh oh is right. I should have been nervous about opening it. I’m very
          long crypto. But I wasn’t even a little bit nervous, because I had no
          doubt what side the Prof would be on and what kind of piece he was
          going to write. And that’s exactly the piece he wrote.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I don’t want this to be a “dunk on the Prof because he’s always
          wrong” piece. My friend and<a href="https://partyround.com/" rel="">
            Party Round</a
          >
          CEO Jordi Hays proclaimed that “<a
            href="https://twitter.com/jordihays/status/1470104945256919042?s=20"
            rel=""
            >shitting on Galloway is played out</a
          >,” and I tend to agree. I didn’t even want to respond.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But then I noticed that he misquoted me and misrepresented things I
          was involved in. Then I looked a little deeper and found errors and
          misdirections galore.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Professor’s piece was a lazy regurgitation of other peoples’
          arguments with some key inaccuracies, intentional or accidental.
          Hundreds of thousands of people read, listen to, and even pay to learn
          from him, and normally it’s not my problem… but if he’s going to
          accidentally pull me into this debate anyway, let’s debate.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Welcome to Debate Club</strong></h3>
        <p>
          At the risk of making myself seem unimaginably cool: I debated
          competitively in high school and college, and actually just started a
          Debate Club in NYC when COVID hit.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In Parliamentary debate, the kind we did at Debate Club, there are two
          teams – the Proposition and the Opposition – who debate a
          <strong>resolution</strong>. The resolution might be something like
          “General AI should have fundamental rights.” The Proposition defends
          the resolution and the Opposition tries to poke holes in it.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The two sides go back and forth making arguments, concluding in a
          <strong>rebuttal</strong> from each team summarizing the debate,
          reiterating their points, and trying to make clear why their side won.
          If you want to read the rules, I wrote up a
          <a
            href="https://packym.notion.site/Debate-Club-Rules-1ab89bab36cc46118b9c4ba5ebab62d2"
            rel=""
            >stripped down version for Debate Club</a
          >.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>There are a few things that you want to do to win a debate.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          The most obvious is that you want to
          <strong>find the most and best evidence in favor of your side</strong
          >.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In the course of your research, you will also find evidence that
          contradicts your side. Be aware of this evidence in case you need to
          defend against it, but by all means, don’t to bring it up (unless, of
          course, you’re playing an advanced game and want to say things like “I
          expect that our opponents will tell you that x, y, z… they’re wrong
          because a, b, c.”). Less scrupulous debaters might even bend or make
          things up.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, the point in a debate is to <strong>win</strong>, not to get
          to the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s Debate 101 type stuff. And then there’s the more advanced shit:
          <strong
            >instead of fighting the battle you were assigned, you start a new
            battle about whatever serves your agenda.&nbsp;</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          An experienced debater will spend a good chunk of her time setting the
          definitions. Take our General AI debate. What is General AI?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Proposition might define General AI as “a being with human-like
          intelligence and emotions indistinguishable from a human in all but
          origin.” If the Opposition lets that definition slide, they’ve
          probably already lost the debate.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          More likely they’ll come back and say that the definition is wrong,
          and that experts agree that, “Artificial general intelligence is the
          hypothetical ability of an intelligent agent to understand or learn
          any intellectual task that a human being can.”&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Proposition might come back and call the Opposition out for using
          the
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence"
            rel=""
            >Wikipedia</a
          >
          definition, reiterate their own, and argue as if their own definition
          is true.&nbsp;

          If General AI is indistinguishable from a human, <em>of course</em> it

        <p>
          If General AI is just a hypothetical ability to understand or learn
          intellectual tasks, it should probably have rights more similar to
          computers than humans.

          Really, if you win the definition battle, the actual points you make
          don’t matter as much.&nbsp;

        <p>
          All to say – debate is a really fun intellectual battle if you’re a
          nerd like me, but it’s not good for finding the truth and it’s not a
          particularly useful way to approach real-world conversations.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, over the past few weeks, a <strong>debate</strong> is
          exactly what the web3 discourse has turned into.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3><strong>The Web3 Discourse: More Debate Than Dialogue</strong></h3>
        <p>
          Probably since the day Satoshi dropped that whitepaper in 2008, there
          have been people who are for crypto and those who are against it.
          Among those who are for it, warring factions fight for the supremacy
          of their coin and chain of choice.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The in-fighting is silly, counterproductive, and never-ending. Bitcoin
          vs. Ethereum. Ethereum vs. All Other Smart Contract L1s. Arbitrum vs.
          Optimism. Bitcoin vs. The World. As I’ve written before, I’m a
          Maximalist Minimalist.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ex-fighting is constant, too, but the angle of attack shifts and
          evolves. First, the anti-argument was that crypto was just used by
          criminals. Then it was that it’s bad for the environment. When one
          criticism is sufficiently disproven, critics move on to the
          next.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Today, the argument seems to be that web3 – inclusive of
            traditional “crypto” and things like dApps, NFTs, social tokens, and
            DeFi – is a construct made up by VCs and isn’t as decentralized as
            you think it is.</strong
          >&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever the <em>raison du jour</em>,
          <strong>people rarely change sides or change their mind</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would imagine you could administer a personality test that had
          nothing to do with crypto – like the
          <a href="https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test" rel=""
            >Big Five Personality Test</a
          >
          – and learn with a high degree of accuracy who is on which side. You
          could do the same by looking at someone’s fifty most recent tweets on
          other technologies or new things. If the people who disliked Elvis and
          Rock ‘N Roll in the 1950s were alive today, chances are, they’d be
          anti-crypto.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So really, what’s happening is that people pick their sides in
          advance, and then try to use whatever evidence they can to make their
          case instead of taking in the evidence and then making up their mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          In that sense, the
          <strong>web3 discourse is more debate than dialogue</strong>.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If we look at it as a Parliamentary debate, the
          <strong>resolution</strong> of this particular one would be something
          like: “<strong>Web3 is good.</strong>”&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Opposition’s opening speech, Jack Dorsey, ex-Twitter and
          current-Block CEO and Bitcoin Maximalist, set the stage for this

          He pushed the idea that
          <strong>VCs own web3, so it’s centralized </strong>into the spotlight.

          earlier this month. His biggest contribution to the Opposition was
          this idea that
          <strong
            >web3 actually relies on a lot more centralized technology than your
            opponents would have you believe.&nbsp;</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that you’ve been trained in the subtlety of debate, you should be
          able to see what’s going on here. Jack and Moxie<strong>
            shifted the battleground to a debate over degrees of
            centralization</strong
          >.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          They’re trying to win the definition battle. Instead of a more vague
          “Web3 is good,” they tightened the focus to a more easily winnable,
          <strong
            >“Web3 is more centralized than it appears from the outside, which
            is bad.”&nbsp;</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Like experienced debaters, Moxie and Jack shifted the battleground
          with subtlety and tact…
        </p>
        <p>
          And then Professor Scott Galloway crashed through the wall like the
          Kool-Aid Man.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Uninvited, Galloway joined the debate and exposed his side’s tricks in
          a ham-handed rebuttal for the Opposition.
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Prof G Enters the Web3 Debate</strong></h3>
        <p>Let me flashback for a minute.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          When I debated in high school, sometimes we’d get randomly assigned
          teams of three. If you got a team with two strong debaters and one
          weak one, ideally, you’d go <strong>strong, weak, strong</strong> for
          the course of your three speeches. The strong lead-off debater could
          set the tone, the weaker one would stumble a little in the middle, and
          then the other strong debater could come in and clean up the mess with
          a powerful <strong>rebuttal</strong>.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, though, the weaker debater would ask to do the rebuttal and
          you didn’t have the heart to tell them no, so you let them go last…
          and it was a train wreck.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The rebuttal is the closing argument. It’s often make or break. In the
          rebuttal, a debater sums up his or her team’s points, once again tears
          down the opposing team’s points, and then tries to tie a compelling
          bow on the whole thing. No new information is allowed in a rebuttal;
          it’s just a summary of what’s been said. The best you can do is use
          more colorful and compelling language on top of the existing points,
          and structure everything in a way that makes your team look
          good.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be fairly easy – there are no new points to make – but in
          the hands of a weak or inexperienced debater, the rebuttal can be a
          disaster.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          When that happens, the problem is often that the two stronger debaters
          were the ones who came up with most of the arguments and figured out
          how they fit together into a larger narrative. They felt the arguments
          in their bones, grokked them on a deeper level, and actually
          understood what they were trying to say, but they needed to rely on
          the weaker debater to deliver them.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Often, even if the weaker debater mostly made the right points, there
          was just something in the delivery and the word choices and the flow
          and the way they leaned on their notes and looked at their partners
          that made it clear that it wasn’t <em>their argument, </em>that they
          didn’t actually know what they were talking about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s what it felt like reading the Prof’s rant against web3.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>

          “Woah!” you might think reading this, “The Prof is wicked smaht! He
          knows about web3 infrastructure, he must know his stuff! I can trust
          everything else he’s saying.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Truth is, this is a bad copy-paste-reword job from Moxie’s piece.
          While he
          <em>did</em> link to the piece (that’s the underline under “people
          don’t want to run their own servers”), he didn’t mention Moxie’s name
          anywhere in the piece or the paragraph.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          That might be forgiven as a style thing. Personally, I would have led
          with something like “As Signal CEO Moxie Marlinspike pointed out…”
          lest people thought I was trying to pass the ideas off as my own, but
          that’s just me. But there are a couple of other things hidden in there
          that show that the Prof was just regurgitating instead of
          understanding.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the only original idea in the paragraph – that people don’t
          want to have to write code every time they buy a loaf of bread –
          <strong>is a straw man</strong>. Of course it would be bad if people
          had to write code to buy bread, but that doesn’t matter because
          <em
            >no one in the world is suggesting that people would need to write a
            single line of code to buy anything</em

              Moxie delivered the second speech, handling some of the
              Proposition’s claims and adding a new point for the Opposition:
              that the tech stack was more centralized than people realized,
              too. Also well done.&nbsp;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Then, the Prof stepped up to deliver the rebuttal for the
              Opposition, and… woof.

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Now, again, I think that the web3 debate is kind of dumb, that there
          are good and bad pieces and good and bad actors, that some things
          should be centralized and others should be decentralized, that nothing
          is all good or all bad (for a more nuanced synthesis of the
          Proposition and Opposition, check out my friend Dror’s

        </p>
        <p>
          Everything, everywhere, always is about trade-offs. Web3 is no
          different. I’d prefer a more constructive conversation that starts
          there. A Debate is so… violent.
        </p>
        <p>
          But like I said, I don’t like when me and my friends are
          misrepresented.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So I decided to dust off the old Debate Pants and enter the fray to
          deliver the rebuttal for the Proposition, “Web3 is good.”&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>
          <strong
            >My Rebuttal for the Proposition in the Web3 Debate&nbsp;</strong
          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          Ladies and gentlemen, judges, teammates, and of course, esteemed
          opponents: thank you for being here this morning for this riveting
          debate.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Because we’ve wandered a little off course, I’d like to remind
          everyone what we’re debating. I’ll read the resolution right from the
          paper to make sure I don’t miss anything: “<strong
            >Web3 is good.</strong
          >”&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the Opposition has tried everything to make this entire debate
          about
          <strong>centralization versus decentralization</strong>. If there is
          centralization anywhere – on the cap table or in the tech stack or in
          the platforms consumers choose to use – they’d have you believe, then
          web3 is bad. And they’ve shown that there is centralization in places.
          Of course there is! You’ll hear no argument here.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that does not mean the Opposition has won, because that’s not what
          this debate is about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arguments around specific attributes of web3, or of any network, like
          centralization or the existence of bad actors, are besides the point,
          like arguing that the internet is bad because Facebook or 4chan
          exist.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We agree openly that there are bad actors and scams and frauds, and
          that a lot of tokens sit in the wallets of a few people. We agree that
          there is a lot more work to be done to build a truly decentralized
          internet for those who want it, and vehemently agree that not
          everybody will.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We’d go even further than our opponents and say that
          <strong>a fully decentralized future is impossible</strong>. Some
          people will always prefer centralized services for everything, many
          more will prefer fully decentralized services for some things and
          centralized ones for others.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But this debate is not about centralization versus decentralization.
          It’s about <strong>choice</strong>.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >This debate is about whether or not web3, an internet owned by the
            users and builders, orchestrated with tokens, is net good or net bad
            for humanity, not just as it stands today in its earliest form, but
            in the promise it holds.</strong
          >
          (<em>See what I did there?)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s about whether the world will be better if entrepreneurs have web3
          tools at their disposal, or not. Again, it’s about choice – choice for
          builders and choice for users.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people will want centralized services, some will want fully
          decentralized ones, many will choose points on the spectrum in between
          that work for them at different times and for different things. We’re
          arguing that they should have that choice.
        </p>
        <p>And we’re arguing that web3 gives them that choice.</p>
        <p>
          But we’ll get there. First, allow me to
          <strong
            >try to dismantle the Opposition’s arguments, as summarized in
            Professor Galloway’s rebuttal</strong
          >. I’ll show you why they’re irrelevant, incorrect, misleading, or
          just plain wrong. Importantly, I’ll show that
          <strong>when the evidence didn’t </strong
          ><em><strong>quite</strong></em
          ><strong> fit, he bent the truth to make it fit.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          This web of lies underpins what the Prof tries to pass off as an
          argument. If you weren’t able to follow it, I understand. I’ll try to
          summarize. It goes something like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          The elites are using the “promise of decentralization” to centralize
          control and achieve unimaginable riches. Centralization is evident in
          NFT and Bitcoin ownership, a Forbes list of twelve (12)
          cryptobillionaires, would-be-monopolies like Coinbase and OpenSea, and
          the infrastructure itself. There’s crime. DAOs aren’t that centralized
          because ConstitutionDAO wasn’t and because they elect representatives,
          and hey, why do we need new internet-native structures when we have
          public companies anyway? Also, centralization is pretty good because
          of the Webb Space Telescope, and web3 tools like NFTs and DAOs have
          potential, but like not that much potential, and regulators need to
          stop the innovators. Also, a16z invested in centralized companies.
          Meet the new boss… he’s your old boss. Plus, Elon’s on my side and
          Gary Gensler better do something. Anyway, Silicon Valley is trying to
          take over the media, the economy, and the military to achieve complete
          tyranny and they do <em>not</em> want web3 to be regulated. Web3 is
          the same thing as Web2.0, and Facebook and Google have too much
          control. Ask someone with teen girls if that’s good.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m exaggerating a little here, but not really. Go back and read his
          piece. That’s the flow. It may not be <em>yoga</em>babble, but it’s
          <em>something</em>babble.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>But an incoherent argument should draw sympathy, not ire.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          What got my blood up were the <strong>four</strong> specific
          misdirections, two of which I was involved in personally, a third
          which I was a part of publicly disproving, and a fourth which is just
          plain numbers. You’ll see that without those, the Prof’s argument
          makes even less sense.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4><strong>Misdirection #1</strong></h4>
        <p>
          Debate is so often a battle of definitions, so my ears perked up when
          the Prof used a modified version of

            >my definition of web3</a

          Yogababble is one of the Prof’s favorite words. He actually repeated
          it later in the piece, arguing that decentralization has “created a
          Coachella for fraud, where anonymity, yogababble, and complexity
          protect the fraudsters from oversight or accountability.” I’m not
          offended by the characterization. I don’t think mine is a perfect
          definition by any stretch.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          What I am a little offended by is that the Prof tweaked my words to
          fit his core argument – that web3 isn’t actually as decentralized as
          it seems. Specifically, he added the word
          <strong>decentralized </strong>to the definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The actual definition I used in the piece that he linked to is:
          “<strong
            >Web3 is the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated
            with tokens</strong
          >.” I intentionally <em>didn’t</em> use the word decentralized because
          I don’t think decentralization is actually the key feature. But it
          does make a good <strong>straw man</strong>, and so the Prof threw it
          in there.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          To be charitable, it’s a subtle difference, and decentralization
          <em>was</em> discussed in the
          <a href="https://future.a16z.com/why-web3-matters/" rel=""
            >piece he referenced</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          But ultimately, that’s not the definition I used. He attempted to
          reframe what I said to fit his argument. He got caught. You can throw
          out that attempt.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4><strong>Misdirection #2</strong></h4>
        <p>The second misdirection is straight numbers.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Galloway uses the chart below to show that, “The advertised
          decentralization of power out of the hands of a few has, in fact, been
          a
          <em>re</em>-centralization of power into the hands of fewer.”

          The chart on the right represents

            rel=""

          >
          data that shows that 2% of accounts own 95% of Bitcoin, meaning that,
          “​​If it were a country, Bitcoin would have the greatest inequality in
          the world.”&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >(Of course, nowhere in the Prof’s argument does he mention that his
            former-enemy-now-ally Jack and his company, Block, are among the
            world’s biggest Bitcoin holders and are in that 2%.)</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s a big hole in that analysis, though, which
          <a
            href="https://insights.glassnode.com/bitcoin-supply-distribution/"
            rel=""
            >Glassnode uncovered last February</a
          >. The 2% includes wallets for exchanges like Coinbase, whose wallets
          hold Bitcoin for millions of people. Adjusting for that, the top 2%
          own 71.5% of Bitcoin. That Glassnode article is not obscure; it’s the
          fourth thing that comes up when you Google “Bitcoin concentration.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We agree that 71.5% is still a heavy concentration; not as sensational
          as 95%, but it has the benefit of being accurate, to the extent that
          matters to our opponent. We agree that we would like to see ownership
          more evenly distributed. But we disagree that it’s relevant to the
          Professor’s argument, especially since to the Prof’s teammate, Jack,
          web3 and Bitcoin are very different.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s another small thing, but I hope you’re picking up a pattern of
          the Prof disregarding any evidence that is inconvenient to his
          case.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4><strong>Misdirection #3</strong></h4>
        <p>
          Next, the Prof argued that DAOs are often not-decentralized by using
          the example of
          <a
            href="https://www.notboring.co/p/lets-buy-the-us-constitution"
            rel=""

              model. In the rush to be able to buy this document, there were a
              lot of details that we were going to figure out after we had won.
              We were actually discussing different governance models had we
              won. One of the big concerns is that some of the large holders in
              the crypto world — we call these whales — would have outsized
              control over what happens with the documents. Our big message is:
              this is a movement for the people. This is the people’s document,
              so we want to have it controlled by the people.</em

              but it’s pretty close. Quadratic voting is another mechanism in
              which voting power is actually diminished when a person has more
              tokens: you don’t have a hundred extra votes for every hundred
              extra tokens, but rather a smaller amount of votes as that number

                out how those votes will be representative of a group of people.
                However, a group of people has to make those decisions; not
                exactly democratic. How is that working for

              that builds something, who then brings it to decentralization. Our
              plan with ConstitutionDAO [was] that, once we win this auction,
              we’re going as fast as we can to becoming fully decentralized to
              the greatest extent possible.</em

          Only in the least charitable interpretation could you read the above
          as “hadn’t established a governance model because they couldn’t figure
          out how to stop whales from taking over.”&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, Jonah mentioned whales in response to Patel’s question about
          whether people would get one vote per token, not as a reason that
          there wasn’t a governance model in place. The truth is the opposite of
          the point that the Prof made; the founders knew <em>exactly </em>how
          to stop whales from taking over: don’t give one vote per token.
        </p>
        <p>As Jonah laid out, the real story was:&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>There was less than a week from idea to auction,</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The team chose to tackle things that weren’t mission-critical,
              like a governance model in the case of a win, until we actually
              won,&nbsp;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The potential governance options were known (Jonah listed a few);
              that wasn’t the bottleneck,
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The plan all along, as it should be for 99.9% of DAOs, was to
              <a
                href="https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/"
                rel=""
                >progressively decentralize</a
              >, which is accepted best practice.&nbsp;
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That’s not me leaning on memory and first-hand experience, that’s
          exactly what Jonah said in the conversation the Prof referenced. The
          Prof just chose to leave out anything that didn’t fit his point.
        </p>
        <p>
          That a 6-day-old project had not yet decentralized is a weak and
          amateur indictment of the concept of DAOs as a whole. Indeed, it seems
          the Prof’s arguments against DAOs more broadly are based on a very
          basic and inaccurate model of governance in which maximum
          decentralization is the goal and every decision should be one person,
          one vote. That doesn’t reflect the reality on the ground.
        </p>
        <h4><strong>Misdirection #4</strong></h4>
        <p>
          Finally, my opponent argued that the decentralization narrative “is a
          false god evangelized by high priests who pass collection plates the
          size of Mars and <strong>admonish regulation as heresy</strong>.”
          <em>[Emphasis mine]</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The language is fun and colorful; the point is simply untrue.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of a handful of Bitcoin maximalists (who tend to hate on web3
          anyway), there is not a single serious person in web3 or crypto or
          whatever you want to call it who doesn’t believe that it should be
          regulated, let alone who believes that regulation is heresy. Every
          founder and investor I’ve ever spoken to on the topic wants regulation
          in the US to come sooner so they can stop building and investing in
          ambiguity.&nbsp;

          These are the facts. But the facts might get in the way of the
          Professor’s good story. Bring the truth to light and all he’s left
          with are, as @Jack would say: “Words.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, there are more examples of little things that betray a lack
          of understanding, or a lack of desire to understand.

          He mentions a16z’s investment in the centralized exchange, Coinbase,
          but not its investment in the decentralized exchange, Uniswap.&nbsp;

        <p>
          He points to data showing that blockchain tokens launched recently
          have more insider ownership at share launch without acknowledging that
          most of those projects were founded and funded during crypto winter
          and needed VC funding to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          No doubt taking a cue from Moxie, he also used OpenSea as an example
          of web3’s centralization. He overplayed his hand without understanding

          Ironically, four days before the Prof published his piece, an NFT
          platform called
          <a href="https://looksrare.org/" rel="">LooksRare</a> launched. NFT
          platforms launch all the time. What made this one particularly
          relevant is how it bootstrapped initial demand.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          LooksRare airdropped 12% of its total $LOOKS token supply on users
          based largely on how much volume they transacted on OpenSea between
          June and December 2021. That data was easy for them to access; it was
          all publicly available on the Ethereum blockchain.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          LooksRare was able to attract OpenSea’s biggest customers by giving
          the biggest rewards to the people who’d spent the most on OpenSea.
          They were also able to induce those customers to perform specific
          activities on LooksRare to unlock those tokens: I wasn’t able to claim
          my 200 $LOOKS until I listed an NFT for sale on the platform. I’ve
          actually never even listed an NFT on OpenSea, but I
          <em>have</em> listed one on LooksRare now!&nbsp;

          It’s early, and there’s a lot of buzz around $LOOKS, but it’s a good
          start. LooksRare is doing 2-3x the daily volume of OpenSea, although
          OpenSea is still smoking LooksRare in terms of Daily Users and Daily
          Transactions.&nbsp;As a few people have pointed out, there’s some
          <a

          and

          at play here, which accounts for the discrepancy, but it’s a good
          start for a week and shows one angle of attack to knock off
          centralized services with decentralized ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, it’s up to LooksRare to build on the early momentum and retain
          and grow its user base. To do that, it architected the platform to
          lower gas fees, rewards users for buying and selling NFTs, charges
          lower trading fees, and shares 100% of fees with $LOOKS holders who’ve
          staked their tokens.&nbsp;

          It’s hard to look at that and call OpenSea a monopoly. That is, of
          course, if you’re looking, if you’re trying to find the truth instead
          of trying to win the debate.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, that’s the point that Jack, Moxie, and certainly Professor
          Galloway missed.
          <strong
            >It’s not about whether any particular platform is centralized, or
            who owns how much of what. It’s about the fact that the data is
            open, that builders and users have choice, and that they’ll choose
            the platforms that extract less and give them more
            ownership.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          In web3, if a platform misleads its users, those users can choose to
          take their data and money to another platform.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It also highlights why the whole debate is practically meaningless.
          While we exchanged words, a few entrepreneurs opened up their laptops,
          built something better, and made the case for web3 better than I ever
          could.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope we can end this silly debate now and engage in more nuanced,
          thoughtful conversation like the one prompted by Moxie’s piece instead
          of loud and inaccurate yelling like the Prof’s. Or just get out of the
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web3 isn’t all good or all bad, but we believe it’s net good, it’s
          happening either way, and it deserves more thoughtful and honest
          critiques and, yes, regulation, in order to reach its full potential.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, I rest my case. Life is so rich.</p>
